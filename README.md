# Air_Canvas_ML

Existing systems: For digital art creation and drawing predominantly rely on physical touch interfaces, like tablets or styluses, which can constrain artists' mobility and precision. These limitations become 
apparent when attempting to create art in diverse settings or on the go. Moreover, conventional touchbased interfaces may not offer the same level of innovative interaction that drawing in the air can 
provide. 
The freedom to express creativity through hand gestures and motion tracking technology opens up new possibilities for artists, designers, and creators, offering a more immersive and intuitive 
canvas that transcends the confines of physical devices. This shift towards air canvas systems promises to redefine digital art creation, making it more versatile, interactive, and adaptable to various creative 
contexts.

Proposed System :
The aim is to develop an AI-powered air canvas system that enables users to create digital artwork through hand gestures in the air. The system should utilize computer vision techniques to track the user's hand movements and convert them into drawings on a virtual canvas. It should provide real-time 
feedback, allowing users to select colors, sizes, and erase mistakes using intuitive gestures. The AI model should be capable of recognizing different shapes and patterns, enhancing the user's drawing 
experience.
